Welcome in the XBTGPUARC Timechain Mining Programm. 

Warning: This is an early-stage learning project.

I’m an absolute beginner in programming – this miner is not safe, stable, or ready to use yet. Please don’t expect a working product here (at least not for now).

About this Project:

* I’m a home mining enthusiast with more than 8 years of mining experience, but new to programming.
* The code is written in a mix of German and English to help me understand what I’m doing while learning.
* Most of the versions I created so far are chaotic, experimental, and not useful to run – but every iteration is part of my personal learning process.
* The hardest part for me is the math behind kernel work and hardware-level coding. This is where I struggle, but also where I learn the most.
* This project is not about money or business. It’s about learning, experimenting, and building tools I want to use myself, instead of waiting for others to build them.


Current State:

* Right now, the public code here is more like a prototype:
* It connects to a pool, requests Bitcoin Gold work, and does some basic handling.
* The kernel studies and experiments I’ve done offline are far more complex, but also too messy to publish at the moment.
* Think of this as a “Quasimodo build” – it walks, but not gracefully.

How to Start this early Quasimodo build?:
* I do not know it realy, but you need to put a folder with the name "kernels" and make there the zhash.cl file in.
* Then, you need to compile it with the makefile on your system. I build that all under Linux Garuda an have no idea about how and if it is running on your OS.
* For fun, change the BTG Wallet Adress to yours, you can find in the files. Just, for better feeling and so on. Later, you also need to do this here but with more compfort to expect.
* Then, start the "run.sh" from your Console out the XBTGPUAR Folder and the programm should make a connection to solo-btg.2miners.com Pool.
* I recommed not to waste your time to much with it in this State!!! Ask me on all the ways i shown up for helping you out if i can do it.

What’s Next?:

I’ll continue to:
* Learn and clean up the code.
* Share my progress step by step.
* Publish new versions whenever I reach something that could be interesting for others.

Final Words:

This repository is a personal research journey.
Feel free to ask questions, share ideas, or just follow along if you’re curious.

Thanks for reading and for your interest!
