Welcome in the XBTGPUARC Timechain Mining Programm. 

Warning: This is an early-stage learning project.

I’m an absolute beginner in programming – this miner is not safe, stable, or ready to use yet. Please don’t expect a working product here (at least not for now).

About this Project:

* I’m a home mining enthusiast with more than 8 years of mining experience, but new to programming.
* The code is written in a mix of German and English to help me understand what I’m doing while learning.
* Most of the versions I created so far are chaotic, experimental, and not useful to run – but every iteration is part of my personal learning process.
* The hardest part for me is the math behind kernel work and hardware-level coding. This is where I struggle, but also where I learn the most.
* This project is not about money or business. It’s about learning, experimenting, and building tools I want to use myself, instead of waiting for others to build them.


Current State:

* Right now, the public code here is more like a prototype:
* It connects to a pool, requests Bitcoin Gold work, and does some basic handling.
* The kernel studies and experiments I’ve done offline are far more complex, but also too messy to publish at the moment.
* Think of this as a “Quasimodo build” – it walks, but not gracefully.

What’s Next?:

I’ll continue to:
* Learn and clean up the code.
* Share my progress step by step.
* Publish new versions whenever I reach something that could be interesting for others.

Final Words:

This repository is a personal research journey.
Feel free to ask questions, share ideas, or just follow along if you’re curious.

Thanks for reading and for your interest!
